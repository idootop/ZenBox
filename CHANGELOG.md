This marks a major milestone in bringing Vue-like reactivity to React with Zustand's simplicity.

### âœ¨ Features

- **`createProvider(initialState)`** - Context provider for local store scoping
- **`useStoreValue(store, options?)`** - Subscribe to store values with optional selectors

#### Vue-like Reactivity

- **`useComputed(computeFn)`** - Reactive computed values with automatic dependency tracking
- **`useWatch(source, callback, options?)`** - Watch for changes with cleanup support
- **`useWatchEffect(effectFn, options?)`** - Effect that automatically tracks reactive dependencies

#### State Management

- **Direct mutations with Immer** - Write `state.count++` instead of spread operators
- **Selective subscriptions** - Only re-render components that use changed data
- **Cross-store computations** - Computed values can depend on multiple stores
- **TypeScript auto-inference** - Zero configuration type safety

### ðŸ“¦ Package

- **ES modules** - Modern module format with tree-shaking support
- **CommonJS** - Backward compatibility for older build systems
- **TypeScript declarations** - Full type definitions included
