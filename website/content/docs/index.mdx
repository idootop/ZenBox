## What if React felt as natural as Vue?

You know that feeling when you write Vue code? Everything just clicks. `computed` values update automatically, `watch` lets you react to changes elegantly, and `ref.value` gives you a consistent way to access everything.

Then you switch to React and... where did all that magic go?

## Vue vibes in React

**ZenBox = Code in React like Vue 💚 + Manage state like Zustand 🐻**

- 💪 **Powerful** - All of Zustand's benefits + more
- ⚡️ **Easy to Use** - Where Vue's simplicity meets React's power
- 📦 **Lightweight** - [100 lines of core code](../blog/react-state-management-in-100-lines), no bloat, just the good stuff

```tsx
// Types are automatically inferred from initial state
const userStore = createStore({
  name: "Del Wang",
  posts: ["Hello World!"],
});

// Computed values that just work
const greeting = useComputed(() => `Hey ${userStore.value.name}!`);

// Watch changes like Vue
useWatch(
  () => userStore.value.posts.length,
  (count) => console.log(`${count} posts now`)
);
```

If you squint, this could be Vue code. But it's React, and it works exactly like you'd expect.

This is ZenBox - where Zustand's simplicity meets Vue's joyful developer experience.
