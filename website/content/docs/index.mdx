## What is ZenBox?

ZenBox is a modern React state management library that combines the simplicity of Zustand with the reactive patterns of Vue. It provides an intuitive API that feels natural to developers familiar with either framework.

```

useWatch(
  () => counter.value.count,
  (current, prev) => console.log("Count changed from", prev, "to", current)
);
```
