## What is ZenBox?

ZenBox is a state management library for React. It is designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy to use.

ZenBox is highly inspired by Vue and Zustand, but combines the best of both worlds in an API that feels natural and intuitive.

```ts
const counter = createStore({ count: 0 });

counter.setState((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }));
```

### 💚 Vue-like DX

```ts
const doubled = useComputed(() => counter.value.count * 2);

useWatch(
  () => counter.value.count,
  (current, prev) => console.log("Changed!", current, prev)
);
```
