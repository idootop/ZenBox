## Why Use Providers?

Providers create **isolated store instances** perfect for components that need their own state without affecting other instances. Think modals, tabs, or any component that appears multiple times.

## Creating a Provider

Use `createProvider` to create isolated, component-scoped stores:

```tsx
const [Provider, useFindStore, storeActions] = createProvider(initialState);
```

For example, you can create a provider for a scoped store with `actions` like this:

```tsx
const [CounterStoreProvider, useFindCounterStore, storeActions] =
  createProvider({
    count: 0,
    increment() {
      // Access store actions within the provider scope
      const state = storeActions.getState();
      storeActions.setState({
        ...state,
        count: state.count + 1,
      });
    },
  });
```

**Notes:**

- The `storeActions` can **ONLY** be used within the initial state's `actions` function
- You can use `useFindStore` to get the store instance from the provider
- It's very similar to Vue's `provide` / `inject` pattern

## Multiple Isolated Instances

You can pass different initial state to different store providers, they are isolated from each other.

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <h1>Independent Counters</h1>

      {/* Each counter is completely isolated */}
      <CounterProvider initialState={{ count: 100 }}>
        <Counter title="Counter A" />
      </CounterProvider>

      <CounterProvider initialState={{ count: 200 }}>
        <Counter title="Counter B" />
      </CounterProvider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Using the Store

Access the provider's store instance within the component tree:

```tsx
function Counter({ title }) {
  // Get the isolated store instance
  const counterStore = useCounterStore();

  // Use like any other store
  const { count } = useStoreValue(counterStore);

  return (
    <div className="counter">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={counterStore.value.increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Perfect isolation made simple. Each provider creates its own universe! ðŸŒŸ
