## useWatch

`useWatch` is a React hook that allows you to subscribe the state changes of a store.

It's similar to `useStoreValue`, but it will **NOT** trigger the component re-render when the state changes.

It's useful when you want to do something when the state changes, but you don't want to re-render the component.

For example, you can use it to log the state changes.

```tsx
useWatch(
  () => counterStore.value.count,
  (current, prev) => {
    console.log("count changed", current, prev);
  }
);
```

By default, it will trigger the effect when the state changes.

### immediate

If you want to trigger the effect immediately, you can use `immediate: true` option.

```tsx
useWatch(
  () => counterStore.value.count,
  (current, prev) => {
    console.log("Immediate", current, prev);
  },
  { immediate: true }
);
```

### once

If you want to trigger the effect only once, you can use `once: true` option.

```tsx
useWatch(
  () => counterStore.value.count,
  (current, prev) => {
    console.log("Only run once", current, prev);
  },
  { once: true }
);
```

### cleanup

You can also return a function to clean up the effect. It's useful when you want to clean up the effect when the component unmounts or before the next effect runs.

```tsx
useWatch(
  () => counterStore.value.count,
  (current, prev) => {
    if (current > 10) {
      const handleClick = () => {
        console.log("Current count", counterStore.value.count);
      };
      window.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
      return () => {
        window.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
      };
    }
  }
);
```

### multiple stores

You can also watch multiple stores at the same time.

```tsx
useWatch(
  () => [counterStore.value, userStore.value] as const, // âœ… use `as const` to infer the type
  ([counter, user]) => {
    console.log("counter and user changed", counter.count, user.name);
  }
);
```

**Note:**

- If you want to watch an array of stores, you can use `[x, y, z] as const` to infer the type.

## useWatchEffect

`useWatchEffect` is similar to `useWatch`, but the effect runs immediately when building the component.

It will auto collect the dependencies and trigger the effect when the dependencies change.

```tsx
useWatchEffect(() => {
  if (counterStore.value.count > 10) {
    console.log("count is greater than 10");
  }
});
```

And also supports cleanup function.

```tsx
useWatchEffect(() => {
  if (counterStore.value.count > 10) {
    const handleClick = () => {
      console.log("Current count", counterStore.value.count);
    };
    window.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
    };
  }
});
```
