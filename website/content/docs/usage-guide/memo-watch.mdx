## Memo

Like `React.memo`, you can use `Memo` to wrap the sub-tree and memoize it.

The sub-tree will only re-render when the watched value changes, useful for expensive UI rendering.

```tsx
<Memo watch={counterStore}>
  {() => {
    // âœ… The whole sub-tree will be memoized, only re-render when the store changes
    return <SubTree />;
  }}
</Memo>
```

You can also watch any computed value and associate it with the sub-tree.

```tsx
<Memo
  watch={() => ({
    count: counterStore.value.count,
    name: userStore.value.name,
  })}
>
  {({ count, name }) => <SubTree count={count} name={name} />}
</Memo>
```

## Watch

Similar to `Memo`, but it doesn't memoize the children, it will re-render when the state changes.

It's useful when you want to re-render the sub-tree when the state changes.

```tsx
<Watch watch={counterStore}>{(count) => <p>Count: {count}</p>}</Watch>
```

You can also watch any computed value and associate it with the sub-tree.

```tsx
<Watch
  watch={() => ({
    count: counterStore.value.count,
    name: userStore.value.name,
  })}
>
  {({ count, name }) => <SubTree count={count} name={name} />}
</Watch>
```
